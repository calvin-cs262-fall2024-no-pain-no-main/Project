## Team: No Pain No Gain!

## Vision Statement

For many people, a healthy lifestyle includes going to the gym. Others still recognize that the gym is useful for being healthy, but are intimidated if they are unfamiliar with it. There are many people who wish to focus on their workout and not be distracted by extraneous variables. Proper rest time can also make a big difference towards making progress at the gym. Our goal with this app is to provide a structure to workouts that lets users get optimal rest time in between sets, while also offering ideas on exercise and micro-learning to aid users in their fitness journey. On a broader scale, users will have the ability to track and visualize their progress through multiple customizable methods. This app is geared for anyone who uses the gym, from first-timers to veterans and anywhere in between. By seamlessly blending structured workout plans with interactive, entertaining, and educational recovery moments, our app transforms traditional exercise routines into an enjoyable adventure.

Unlike standard fitness apps that treat rest as just another timer, our app aims to keep users engaged and motivated during downtime with games, meditations, microlearning, and expert tips, making every second of the workout a productive and enjoyable experience. Our app aims to keep users from getting sidetracked while resting so that they do not rest for too long or not for long enough. Ample amounts of rest are vital for benefiting the gym, both in terms of muscle growth and overall strength. Other fitness apps may offer workout ideas, or a timer, but very few tend to integrate these together. Seamlessly blending these two will eliminate distractions and keep focus consistently high throughout the workout.
